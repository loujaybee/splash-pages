            <ul>
                <li>Do you share your Netflix with your mates?</li>
                <li>Are they still using it for free?</li>
                <li>Would you like them to pay? </li>
            </ul>
            <p>But it's awkward... as it's only maybe £3 a month right?</p>
            <p>Yet £3 a month for 3 mates is <strong>£324</strong> ... jeeze! </p>

            <p>We know it's not much money... but it <i>is</i> awkward asking for it</p>
            <p>What if there was a simple way to send them a link and get paid on time, every month?</p>
            <p>Well there is... and it's called Splitoo.</p>

            <h2>What is Splitoo?</h2>
            <p>With Splitoo your life could be a <i>whole</i> lot easier.</p>
            <p>And if you're wondering how, let us explain...</p>
            <img src="../splitoo.png" alt="">
            <p><a href="splitoo.com">Splitoo</a> is an online recurring payments platform.</p>
            <p>With <a href="splitoo.com">Splitoo</a> payments for your students are collected on a schedule that <i>you</i> define.</p>
            <p>This means you get paid on time every week (or how often you teach) <i>even</i> if a student misses a session. So that means you decide whether to refund them (or not!).</p>
            <p>Now you can book that holiday, or plan that birthday because you know exactly when and how much you're going to get paid.</p>
            <p>Sound too good to be true? Let us walk you through how it works?</p>

# Run Your Guitar Teaching Business ... Without The Stress!

* Do you ever get envious of your friends 9-to-5 income stability?
* Does knowing when you'll get paid to cover your bills keep you up at night?
* Do your students ever drop out?

Sound like you?

# We can help

We know running a small guitar teaching business can be hard.

You've got a lot on your plate...

* Find new students
* Schedule new students
* Ensure they arrive on time
* Reply to their messages / queries

And we know that's not the half of it.

But, with Splitoo your life could be a _whole_ lot easier.

If you're wondering how, let us explain...

# What is Splitoo?

Splitoo is an online recurring payments platform.

With Splitoo payments for your students are collected on a schedule that _you_ define.

This means you get paid on time every week (or how often you teach) _even_ if a student misses a session. So that means you decide whether to refund them (or not!).

Now you can book that holiday, or TK because you know exactly when and how much you're going to get paid.

Sound too good to be true? Let us walk you through how it works?

# How it works

* Step 1) Create a payment plan e.g. £15 per week
* Step 2) Send a URL to sign up your student
* Step 3) Monitor your payments.
* Step 4) Withdraw on your schedule.

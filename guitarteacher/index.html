                <li>Does knowing if you can cover your bills keep you up at night?</li>

            <p>With Splitoo your life could be a <i>whole</i> lot easier.</p>
            <p>And if you're wondering how, let us explain...</p>
            <img src="../splitoo.png" alt="">
            <p><a href="splitoo.com">Splitoo</a> is an online recurring payments platform.</p>
            <p>With <a href="splitoo.com">Splitoo</a> payments for your students are collected on a schedule that <i>you</i> define.</p>
            <p>This means you get paid on time every week (or how often you teach) <i>even</i> if a student misses a session. So that means you decide whether to refund them (or not!).</p>
            <p>Now you can book that holiday, or plan that birthday because you know exactly when and how much you're going to get paid.</p>
            <p>Sound too good to be true? Let us walk you through how it works?</p>

            <img src="guitarteacher.jpg" alt="">
            <p><strong> Step 1 </strong> - Create a payment plan (e.g. Â£15 per week)</p>
            <p><strong> Step 2 </strong> - Send a URL to sign up your student</p>
            <p><strong> Step 3 </strong> - Monitor your payments.</p>
            <p><strong> Step 4 </strong> - Withdraw when you want.</p>
